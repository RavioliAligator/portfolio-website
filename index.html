        <p>Visual arts student, storyboarder, and character designer</p>
        <p>I’m Emma Harkin. Or just Jo.</p>
        <p>Most of my work is very story and character driven. Recently,
        I’ve been doing a lot of traditional stand-alone pieces for
        school, but I’m enjoying the chance to complete high quality
        works while I decide what to pursue for a career. I think it’s
        important to write characters that extend beyond your artworks
        and have their own lives ‘offscreen.’</p>
